## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about building intelligent, scalable applications, and solving real-world problems with code. I have proven experience in the following technologies:

- ☁️ Web Development - Javascript, Java, Typescript, React, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, GenAI, AWS
- 🐍 AI/ML - Python, R, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, ETL Pipelines, n8n AI Agents

👨‍💻 My recent projects include:

### MocsCode [(mocscode.com)](https://www.mocscode.com)
- Developed a full-stack collaborative code editor in a team of 2, enabling real-time multi-user editing using React,
Node.js, Supabase, and Socket.io, leveraging GenAI coding assistants throughout the 7-week development process.
- Implemented secure backend systems for sandboxed code execution supporting Java, Python, C/C++, and C# via
Judge0 REST API, averaging 1.3s response time.
- Deployed for production use by Florida Southern's C.S. Department, serving 40+ programming students starting Fall
2025, with automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for deployment to Contabo VPS with nginx.

### Artist Portfolio Website [(lorihiggsthompsonart.com)](https://www.lorihiggsthompsonart.com)

- Contracted to develop a professional artist portfolio website in 4 weeks using React, Node.js Express, Airtable API,
and Resend email API, resulting in 10% increase in client sales post-launch.
- Built responsive gallery interface with 4 custom API endpoints for dynamic artwork management, displaying realtime availability status, and streamlined contact forms.

🔭 I’m currently working on an AI-powered fitness automation ecosystem that uses specialized AI agents connected through n8n workflows to intelligently manage health data, schedule workouts, and provide personalized fitness insights. 🏃 Users interact with the system through a React web interface with Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database, creating a seamless personal fitness management experience! ✨

🌱 I am passionate about my hobby of Home-Labbing and Networking, and love experimenting with creative Smart Home Automation solutions via Home Assistant ecosystem 🧠
