## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about building intelligent, scalable applications, and solving real-world problems with code. I have proven experience in the following technologies:

- ☁️ Web Development - Javascript, Java, Typescript, React, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, GenAI, AWS
- 🐍 AI/ML - Python, R, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, ETL Pipelines, n8n AI Agents

🔭 I’m currently working on an AI-powered fitness automation ecosystem that uses specialized AI agents connected through n8n workflows to intelligently manage health data, schedule workouts, and provide personalized fitness insights. 🏃 Users interact with the system through a React web interface with Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database, creating a seamless personal fitness management experience! ✨

🌱 I am passionate about my hobby of Home-Labbing and Networking, and love experimenting with creative Smart Home Automation solutions via Home Assistant ecosystem 🧠
